#### Module #1: Image Recognition (with TensorFlow Lite)
- This module aims to demonstrate how to work with the TensorFlow Lite for classifying an image<br>
from a computer screen.<br>
#### Module #2: <em>A Dynamic feature<em> - Image Processing (with GAN via AnimeGANv2)
- This module aims to demonstrate how to transforming images into anime-style pictures.<br>

#### Module #3: Face Detection (with Google ML Kit)
(Note that the face is blurry because it is pretty small in the original image.
<br>This configuration was chosen on purpose to protect the personâ€™s privacy.)
This module aims to demonstrate how to work with the Google ML Kit for face detection and 
<br>verify that the face detected in the source image can be extracted.
- #### Module #4: Text Recognition (with Google ML Kit - Java version) 
This module aims to demonstrate how to work with the Google ML Kit for text recognition and 
<br>verify that the text recognized in the source image can be extracted.
